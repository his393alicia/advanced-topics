**Introduction** 

I am applying to the small team grant for the maximum of $50,000 over 1-3 years. The Google Ngram Viewer graphs social change by examining word frequency in five million books: “pet” was stagnant from 1847 to 1946 [Coleman 484](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30031780). Then, it increased 450% between 1947 and 2000, indicating a colossal shift in pet culture after World War Two [Coleman 484](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30031780). My research question is "Why did pet ownership (particularly dogs), icnrease dramatically after World War Two?" My tentative thesis is that this shift in pet culture was a two part process. First, real and fictional cultural depictions increased the value and desire to own a pet dog. Real, albeit embellished, stories include war dogs and the sled dogs of the 1925 Nome Serum run. Fictional depictions include Rin Tin Tin and Lassie. The second step is the consumerism and prosperity of the post-war period. More North Americans had the means and desire to have companion animals who did not earn their keep and were a luxury. The broader postwar changes of consumerism, prosperity, suburbinization and notions of family also influenced this shift. These changes are evident in material culture, records, advertisements. For instance, the pet industry took off during the post-war period. North Americans could now buy luxuries such as dog clothes or dog food. The items themselves, catalogues and advertisements are sources. If the city or country mandates pet licenses, then there should be an increase. The American Kennel Club will also have records of increased registrations. 

Digital history is essential because the goal is an accessible project that involves some crowd sourced contributions. The final project will be a website consisting of four sections. The first section is the historical analysis where I will answer the research question. The second section is an archive of related material culture. I will travel to New York City and St. Louis to visit the American Kennel Club and Purina's respective headquarters. Their archives are not publicly accessible and I intend to digitize them. The inspiration is [The Pet Historian](https://thepethistorian.com/). The third section is a collection of cultural depictions, from films, television shows, print advertisements and advertisements. The fourth section is the community and crowd sourced aspect. We are inviting people to submit their own material sources and stories. For instance, someone who grew up in the mid-twentieth century with dogs can submit their experiences. This can be done through text, recorded video or audio, or interviews. Or those with vintage dog products or advertisements can contribute to the archive. Digital history enables the project to be interactive and multimedia. The history of pets is a niche specialty with few primary and secondary sources. Thus, the website and online archives will make the field more accessible. An approachable and entertaining website also entices non-academic dog enthusiasts, thus broadening the audience and reach.

**Methods**

I will use programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build this website. For other languages such as Python and difficult codes, I will hire programmers or graduate students in computer science. 

The first section will be a simple web page that publishes the research findings. Images, photographs, newspaper articles, photos of material culture and multi-media will also be included. 

The second section is an archive of pet related products and catalogues. Its core design is the card deck that we worked. Site visitors can find items by typing in a search bar or browsing categories, such as food, cages and toys. I will input every thing we know about the item, from its year, materials, dimensions, price and context.  

The third section is an archive of advertisements, television, music, films and commercials featuring pets. Visitors will be able to find sources through a search bar, categories and by year. We can also annotate commercials, films and audios using Popcorn. These popcorn footnotes complement the media by providing context.

The final section is where interested people can submit their own materials and experiences. For instance, individuals who owned pets during the post-war period can publish their experiences. They can do this through a Google Form. Our project accepts written accounts, photographs, videos and audio files. This form requires contact information, which allows researchers to follow up for additional questions. People can also donate their vintage pet products to the archive.

We are acquiring sources to digitize from a plethora of places. As previously mentioned, I will be travelling to the American Kennel Club and Purina's headquarters to digitize their archives. Private archives are extremely limiting. After all, only historians with resources can fly to access these materials. Furthermore, these private organizations only give select historians access. This is constricting for historians who are interested in pet and animal history. Additionally, these barriers prevent prospective animal historians from joining and contributing to this specialty. These resources will be available to everyone, not just academics. Traditionally, higher education and academia is rife with barriers. For instance, those interested in  academic papers often face paywalls.

**Timeline**

The tenative timeline of this project is three years. I will take two one week trips to New York City and St. Louis. If the digitization requires more time, I will enlist the help of local university students. Researching and writing the paper will require upwards of six months. Compiling and acquiring the sources will require six months to a year. After all, these sources are not just digital. For instance, the majority of vintage dog food ads are sold on Ebay. Launching the website is also expected to take a year. Once the website launches, we need a minimum of a year for the community contributions. However, this project's goal is to last longer than three years. This duration is to establish the site. But we want this site to last beyond the initial three years and become a reputable source of pet history.

**Importance**

Pets are ubiquitous in North American life. They are a central aspect of our everyday lives and families. Since World War Two, pet ownership has been increasing and shows no signs of slowing down. Likewise, North Americans are spending even more on their pets for services like daycare and grooming. For instance, Americans spent [$99 billion](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp) on their pets this year. Pets are emotionally, culturally and economically significant. Consequently, the history of pets intersects with the evolution of human nature, emotional life, individual responsibility, society obligations to dependents, childhood, gender roles, class structures, business, environmentalism, science, technology, municipal governments, public health and even more [Grier location 218 in the Kindle version](https://www.amazon.ca/Pets-America-Katherine-C-Grier-ebook/dp/B00ZVEJWEU/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=pets+in+america+a+history&qid=1608873788&sr=8-1). In essence, a history of pets is a history of North America. 

And yet, this field is understudied with comparatively few works. Perhaps the biggest barrier is the difficulty in obtaining primary sources. Many of these sources are at risk of disappearing. For instance, most dog food advertisements are privately sold on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=dog+food+ad&_sacat=0). These ads will likely become inaccessible in private hands. Or the seller may discard the ads if they fail to sell. Likewise, material culture such as vintage toys or clothes are at risk of being discarded. If the owners are unaware of the object's historical significance, it is likely going to a landfill. Another instance of rare sources are the private catalogues of early pet companies. Most of them are no longer operating. Even sources from organizations who are still in business are largely inaccessible. It entails obtaining permission and the resources to travel to the archive. This is difficult for many academics, much less students and the general public. The preservation and democratization of pet related materials is goal of this project.

The research emphasizes the post-war period. There are still many people alive who experienced this era from a variety of life stages – from children to adults – who are primary sources themselves. This broadens and diversifies the sources historians work with. It also provides a unique look into everyday pet ownership. Collecting these experiences provides future historians with even more sources and specializations. For instance, a future researcher can write a paper on dog ownership in New York City or among immigrants. In contrast, present pet history is largely limited to middle class, white ownership and pets who were taken care of.

Accessibility to all is another key goal of this project. This includes academics, students and simply interested members of the public. The interactive crowd sourcing empowers non-historians to participate in history. In essence, this project seeks to contribute to the field of pet history by answering the research question and enabling even more research by providing sources to other historians.
