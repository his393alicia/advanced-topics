For millennia, dogs have been indispensable to Inuit life and survival. They were sled dogs, transportation, hunters, companions and spiritual guides [1]. Consequently, the Inuit sled dog massacres of the mid twentieth century is a “flashpoint” of indigenous trauma [2]. Between the 1940s and 1960s, the RCMP killed thousands of Inuit dogs in th Baffin region. To this day, many Inuit peoples maintain this was part of the organized and intentional effort to assimilate Inuits into Canadian settler society [3]. Oral histories of this theory and trauma has been passed throughout the generations. However, a 2006 RCMP report, a 2008 independent Qikiqtani Truth Commission and historians agree that while the RCMP did kill dogs, there is no evidence that this was part of a systematic and organized conspiracy. Nevertheless, the emotional and cultural devastation is real.

The origins of the massacre can be traced to January 1949, when the Northwest Territories government, which lacked any Inuit representation, implemented the an ordinance that banned the Inuit from allowing their dogs to wander [4]. It mandated that the Inuit chain their dogs [5]. However, chains and collars were not widely available [6]. Furthermore, the tethering of dogs violated traditional Inuit dog culture and practices [7]. Regardless, any wandering dog could be seized, sold or killed [8] Many Inuit peoples, such as Ipeelie Koonoo, the oral history source, reluctantly complied. 

Simultaneously, the Canadian government pressured the Inuit to settle in communities and settler life. These communities were where the RCMP enforced the dog laws. The Inuit faced pressure to assimilate. For instance, the government required all indigenous children enroll in the Canadian education system [9]. Consequently, families moved to thees communities – with their beloved dogs – to be close to their children [10]] In these communities, sled dogs, Inuit culture and settler colonialism collided [11].

The government viewed Inuit dogs as dangerous, outdated commodities. According this this view, the sled dogs were not beloved companions or family members – but commodities – tools that modern technology, such as snowmobiles, rendered obsolete [12]. The RCMP killing dogs was not only emotionally traumatic to the Inuit, but impeded their traditional way of life. For instance, pressuring the Inuit to abandon their nomadic lifestyles, hunting and practice of allowing their dogs to wander limited their ability to feed their dogs [13].
  
After Inuit sled dogs were wiped out, the RCMP placed the Inuit in an even more difficult position. They were unable to hunt and freely travel in the communities they were pressured to settle in [14]. Koonoo mentions that after the police killed his dogs, he had no transportation or ability to hunt. In essence, unintentional or not, it was a direct attack on Inuit identity – the experience of raising dogs, hunting, their relationship with the land [15]. Furthermore, the Inuit communities were in isolated areas accessible only by plane – later by snowmobile. So when the RCMP killed the sled dogs, they also killed Inuit freedom of movement and agency. Mobility is a central aspect of Inuit culture, particularly in regards to travel and hunting [16]. Furthermore, the Inuit communities were in regions where food, particularly animal based food, was hard to come by [17]. As previously mentioned, the sled dogs were the Inuit gateway to hunting [18]
  
The 2006 RCMP report determined there was no evidence these individual killings were part of a larger campaign [19]. Furthermore, they justified these killings on the grounds of safety [20]. The report also emphasizes the benefits of Inuit settlement and assimilation, such as improved healthcare and education [21]. In contrast, the Qikiqtani Truth Commission, which directly interviewed Inuit peoples such as Koonoo, concluded that the dog killings were the product of fear [22]. This was a fear based on colonial narratives of civilization, hygiene and safety [23]. These narratives are then used to justify violence and expanded governnance [24]. Since the RCMP officers enforced laws based on colonial ideals of civilizing and commodifying nature, the Qikitani Inuit Association maintains there is “no need for a conspiracy” [25].

Professor Frank Tester notes while there are oral histories of this theory, there is no other evidence [26]. He attributes it to culture shock - “It was one of the most rapid periods of social change for any ethnic group in all of human history... Within 10 years they went from a semi-nomadic life to living in modern communities with woodframe houses, electricity and snowmobiles” [27]. However, he still emphasizes that there were RCMP officers who were "dangerously racist and violent" [28]. There were communication disparities to due language barriers - so the ordinances seemed like a plot not a safety measure [29] 

The audio clip is an interview conducted by the Qikiqtani Truth Comission. It is one of almost 300 interviews with Inuit peoples. Its purpose is to archive not only experiences with the dog killings, but to preserve Inuit history. In this audio, Ipeelie Koonoo, who was born in 1940 on Bylot Island, recalls his life and experiences. He specifically recounts the day where the police shot his sled dogs *while* he was on a boat working *for* them.

The juxtaposition between Inuit and official or academic interpretations illustrates the tensions in oral history. These conflicts are especially controversial in issues such as indigenous reconciliation. How should historians and Canadians grapple with two interpretations? While there is no evidence aside from oral histories that the dog killings were part of a wider conspiracy, these testimonies illustrate the real trauma these killings and the belief that it was systematic caused. Consequently, reparations are still important, as are official apologies and acknowledgements of the deaths. 

Inuit sled dogs are Nunavut’s official animal. [30]. Before colonization, there were 20,000 sled dogs – today there are 300 [31]. The Inuit sled dogs populations parallel the loss of Inuit land, lifestyles and culture.  In essence, it is almost unanimously agreed that there was no organized effort to kill Inuit dogs. But there are “irreconcilable differences between the official Canadian and lived Inuit” version [32].There are tensions between “two truths” [33]. It reveals the problems with oral history [34]. But how much does it matter when the stories have done real harm and trauma?
